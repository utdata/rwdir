# Intro to ggplot

::: callout
The chapter is by Prof. Lukito with some updates by Prof. McDonald. We don't remember who wrote what, so perhaps it's the McLuk version.
:::

This week, we'll move on from summaries to talking about data visualizations ("data viz"), an essential skill for any data journalist. While there are a lot of different ways to make figures and graphs, this chapter will focus on one popular R package for data viz: `ggplot`.

## Goals for this section

In this chapter, we'll learn the basics of **data visualization** using the Grammar of Graphics principles. We'll start with some smaller datasets to give you a sense of how the code works. And, in the next chapter, you'll apply this to a dataset we have already used in the class.

Our learning goals are:

- To learn about the Grammar of Graphics
- To make scatterplots
- To make bar charts

## Introduction to ggplot

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is the data visualization library within Hadley Wickham's [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). It is **a beast** of a package because it supports a whole variety of different types of data visualizations, from [bar charts](https://r-graph-gallery.com/barplot.html) and [line charts](https://r-graph-gallery.com/line-plot.html) to fancy [choropleth maps](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/choropleth-map.html) and [animated figures](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/animation.html).  

Even though the package is called `ggplot2`, the function to make graphs is just `ggplot()`. So, for simplicity, we'll just call everything `ggplot`.

The `ggplot` package relies on a concept called the [Grammar of Graphics](https://byrneslab.net/classes/biol607/readings/wickham_layered-grammar.pdf), hence the `gg` in `ggplot`. The basic logic of the Grammar of Graphics is that any graph you could ever want to build will need similar things: a data set, some information about the scales of your variables, and the type of figure or graph that you want to create. These various things can be "layered" on top of each other to create a visually pleasing plot.  

Folks who have used Adobe creative programs (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.) can think about it like laying an image: each layer in your image *should do something* to change the image. Likewise, each layer in a `ggplot` figure will add to the overall graph.

### What I like/dislike about ggplot

Let me just start by saying that I'm a total `ggplot` geek. I'll talk about `ggplot` figures the way people talk about new TikTok trends. When producing figures and graphs in R, `ggplot` is the **absolute best approach** because you'll see the results right in your notebook. And, basic data visualizations are an absolutely essential skill for any data journalist: it helps you find important things in your data that you may ultimately report on. So, `ggplot` is important for any R-based data journalism project.

That being said, there are less complicated ways of creating publishable graphics. Tools like [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) and [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) can produce equally beautiful graphics without the code. So why learn `ggplot`? Because, **(1)** `ggplot` is super useful when you're just learning about the data and **(2)** to get good enough in `ggplot` to make publishable graphics, you have to practice, practice, practice. Yes, `ggplot` is a big package with lots of nuance. But the more you take the time to learn it, the more you will master it.

### The Grammar of Graphics

This section was inspired by [Matt Waite](http://www.mattwaite.com/) and the [BBC Visual Cookbook](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/).

As I said above, the `gg` in `ggplot` stands for "Grammar of Graphics," which is a fancy way of saying we'll build our charts layer by layer. There are three main things you need to make a plot:

- **data**: You have to tell ggplot the name of the object with your data.
- **mapping**: Defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties (**aesthetics**) of your plot. i.e., which columns are on the x or y axis. We use the function `aes()` to describe these aesthetics.
- **geometries**: This how you describe the shape of your visualization, whether it's lines, bars, points, or something else. We do this through different `goem_()` functions.

In addition to these three things, there are lots of helper layers we'll learn about along the way, including:  

- **themes** ("theme"): this is where you tell R the font you'd like to use, the background color, and other things you want to "pretty up" the data viz.
- **coord_flip**: a special layer for flipping the chart  
- **scales**: transforming the data to make the plot more read-able  
- **labels** ("labs"): for making titles and labels   
- **facets**: For graphing many elements of the same data set in the same space (one dataset, multiple figures)  

This all may seem complicated now, but it'll make sense once we start putting together these layers together, one at a time. After all, the best way to learn any R package is to **do it**.

## Start a new project

1. Get into RStudio and make sure you don't have any other files or projects open.
2. Create a new **Quarto Website** project, name it `yourname-ggplot` and save it in your rwd folder.
3. (No need for a folder structure, we'll do this all in one file.)
4. We'll use our `index.qmd` file for everything for this project, so update the title as "ggplot practice", remove the boilerplate and create a setup section that loads `library(tidyverse)` and `library(janitor)`, like we do with every notebook.

The `ggplot` package is a part of `tidyverse`, so we don't need to do anything special there.

```{r setup, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```


### Install palmerpenguins

For this lesson, we will install a new R package, which will give us access to some data to work through some visualization techniques. I'd like you to meet the Palmer Penguins ...

![Artwork by @allison_horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png)

We don't _need_ this dataset to plot charts, but it is a great one for data exploration & visualization so we'll use it to learn about ggplot.

The [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package includes scientific measurements of penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. The package and the awesome artwork is maintained by Allison Horst.

Let's install and load it.

1. In your Console, run `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`.
2. In your setup section, add the library and rerun the chunk: `library(palmerpenguins)`

Remember you only have to **install** a package once on your computer, but you should load the **library** at the top of each notebook that uses it. (i.e., don't leave the `install.packages()` part in your notebook.)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: palmerpenguins

library(palmerpenguins)
```


## The layers of ggplot

::: callout-note
Much of this first plot explanation comes from Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html), with edits to fit the lesson here.
:::

Before we dive into `ggplot`, let's peek at our data.

1. Start a new section "First plot"
1. Add some text that you are studying pretty penguins.
2. Add a code chunk like below and run it to see what the `penguins` dataset looks like.

```{r}
#| label: p-data

penguins
```

As noted above, the data are measurements from a number or penguins, things like species, sex, bill length, etc.

Among the variables in penguins are:

- `flipper_length_mm`: length of a penguin’s flipper, in millimeters.
- `body_mass_g`: body mass of a penguin, in grams.
- `species`: a penguin’s species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo).

With these variables, we'll explore the relationship between flipper lengths and body masses of these penguins, taking into consideration the species of the penguin.

### Our goal chart {#sec-goal-chart}

Our goal is to recreate this chart:

```{r}
#| label: fig-penguin-example
#| fig-cap: "Our goal graphic"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  )
# +
#   scale_color_colorblind()
```

### 1st: the data

When working with the `ggplot2` package, you'll start nearly every figure with the `ggplot()` function. In the `ggplot()` function, you'll tell R what data you're using, and the coordinate system you want to build based on the data.

The first thing you'll want to do is tell `ggplot` the dataset you want to use (in this case, `penguins`). Let's do that now.

1. **Edit** your first plot section, 
2. Make a new code chunk and add the code below.

```{r base-plot}
ggplot(penguins)
```

This tells us... absolutely nothing! But that's not surprising: you haven't even told `ggplot` what variables you want to focus on or the way you want to visualize the data. To do that, you'll need a mapping argument.

### 2nd: Map the data

We use the `aes()` (short for "aesthetic") to describe which data to plot and where. This is considered a _mapping_ argument, because you use this argument to tell `ggplot` how you want to map your data.

The workhors of `aes()` is to indicate the variable to plot horizontally (the `x` axis) and vertically (the `y` axis). So your `aes()` argument will look something like this: `aes(x = some_variable, y = another_variable)`.

In our case, set our `flipper_length_mm` (the flipper length) for `x` and `body_mass_g` for `y`:

1. **Edit** your code to add the following line of code. Note I've rearranged the indenting, too.

```{r p-aes}
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
)
```

We are getting closer! The plot knows what data we are using and the "range" of that data, so it has added tick marks and values along our `x` and `y` axes.

### 3rd: geometries

Now that we know which data to apply, we have to make a choice on how we want to show the shape of that data on our plot, and we do that through **geometries** (or "geoms" as we call them.) We'll talk about different ones in a minute, but we'll start with plotting our data as points.

This is our first _added_ layer on our chart, and therefore introduction of the `+` option within ggplot. We use `+` to add on layers of information in our grammar of graphics. It's _sort of_ like the pipe `|>` in the way it works, but we use `+` when adding ggplot layers.

1. **Edit** your chunk to add the `+` and the `geom_point()` functions as noted below.

(I _really_ recommend you type the additions so you can see how RStudio helps fill the code.)

```{r}
#| label: p-point

ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) + #<1>
  geom_point() #<2>
```

1. Don't forget the `+` here
2. The `geom_point()` plotted dots based on the values set in our `aes()` function.

OK, now we are getting somewhere. We can **see** each penguin plotted on the chart, and we can generally see that as the birds get heavier (higher on vertical axis) their flippers are also longer (to the right on the horizontal axis.)

::: callout-note
We do get this warning: `Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values geom_point()`. This is telling us there are two rows of data that don't have one of the two values, so they were dropped. Like R, ggplot2 subscribes to the philosophy that missing values should never silently go missing. As journalists, we just need to make sure we know why something is missing and note if it is important.
:::

#### Other geometries

There are [many geoms](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf), but here are a few common ones:

- `geom_point()` adds dots onto the grid based on the data. We used them above.
- `geom_line()` adds lines between data points on the grid. Basically a line chart.
- `geom_col()` and `geom_bars()` adds bars to the grid based on values in the data. A bar chart. We'll use `geom_col()` later in this lesson but you can read about the difference between the two in a later chapter.
- `geom_text()` adds labels based on values in the data.

### Chart code review

Let's review the different parts of this code. Note I've rewritten it a bit here to put some arguments on their own line so it is more readable.

```r
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Think of this like painting a chart:

- `ggplot()` is the function we use to make a chart.
- Inside of `ggplot()` the first argument is the data, in this case the `penguins` data.
- The second argument is the `aes()` function, where we apply our **aesthetics**. Aesthetics describe how we will paint our data onto the plot. Inside of this function, we set values for the `x` and `y` axis so we know WHERE to paint. There are some other aesthetic values we can paint with data, and we will.
- Lastly we add on a layer (with `+`) to add `geom_point()` to paint "points" on top of the plot based on the set aesthetics. (It's like [pointillism](https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/pointillism-7-things-you-need-to-know!).)

::: callout-important
You might see this same code written different ways. Let's talk about why.

#### Verbose arguments {.unnumbered}

```r
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```

The above version adds `data = ` and `mapping =` to the first two arguments. It is the official descriptive way to do this, and how Hadley Wickham describes it in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html). But, since the first argument can assumed to be the data we often don't include it unless it unless we are trying to differentiate with different data used later. Same goes for `mapping =` ... we don't specify it unless necessary.

#### Piping into ggplot {.unnumbered}

```r
penguins |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```

In this case we start with the data AND THEN pipes it into `ggplot()` as the first argument. Prof. McDonald often does it this way. The scoundrel.
:::

### Global vs local aesthetics

Our initial plot appears to show that flipper length is related to the weight of the penguin, but it’s always a good idea to be skeptical of any apparent relationship between two variables and ask if there may be other variables that explain or change the nature of this apparent relationship. For example, does this relationship exist for all three species?

Let's color our points based on the species to see.

1. **Edit** your plot and add the color mapping to the `aes()` function, like below. **NOTE** I've also rearranged some of the code to make it more readable.

```{r}
#| label: p-color
#| warning: false
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species) # <1>
) +
  geom_point()
```

1. This is the line were yo uare adding color.

When a categorical variable like the `species` is mapped to an aesthetic, ggplot will assign a color to each unique value and add a legend so you can tell them apart.

Let's add another layer: a smooth curve displaying the relationship between body mass and flipper length. Since this is a new geometric object representing our data, we will add a new geom as a layer on top of our point geom: geom_smooth(). And we will specify that we want to draw the line of best fit based on a linear model with `method = "lm"`.

2. **Edit** your code to add on the last layer shown here:

```{r}
#| label: p-smooth
#| warning: false
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

We've added the lines, but it doesn't look like our "goal" graphic we started with in @sec-goal-chart, which only has one line instead of three separate lines for each of the penguin species.

When we set the `x`, `y` and `color` aesthetics in our code, we set them at the _global_ level. All those characteristics apply to every added layer. However, each geom function can have it's own aesthetics, setting them at the _local_ level, applying to only that layer.

Let's show this by moving our color aesthetic from the global level to apply just at the point level.

3. **Edit** your code to move the `color = species` bit from the _global_ aesthetics to a _local_ aesthetic within `geom_point()`, as shown below.

```{r}
#| label: p-local
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g) # <1>
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) + # <2>
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

1. This is the line where we remove the `color = species` function.
2. This is where we add it back, creating an `aes()` function inside `geom_point()` so it only applies to that geom.

OK, this is looking pretty good, but it is not a great idea to represent information using only colors on a plot, as people perceive colors differently due to color blindness or other color vision differences. We can improve readability of this chart of we also map species based on the shape aesthetic.

4. **Edit** your code to add `shape = species` aesthetic to the `geom_point()` function, as shown below.

```{r}
#| label: p-shape
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) + #<1>
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

1. We add the `shape = species` argument here inside the `aes()` function.

### Labels

In addition to geoms, you can adjust and add labels (text layers) to our plot.

**Labels** (or labs, since we use the `labs()` function for them) are a series of text-based items we can layer onto our plots like titles, bylines and axis names.

Like `geom_point()` above, we'll use the `+` at the end of each line before we add another layer.

Let's add a labels layer so we can describe our chart to our readers. Note there are a number of arguments available in `labs()`, even more than those listed here.

1. **Edit** your code to add the `labs()` layer indicated below.

```{r}
#| label: p-labs
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  )
```

Walking through that a bit

1. We start with the `labs()` function and open it up to write many arguments inside.
2. `title` gives us a headline.
3. `subtitle` is a readout under the headline. We sometimes need to wrap the text in a `str_wrap()` function to keep it from running out of the chart.
4. The `x` axis already had a label on our chart by default, but it was the non-very-print-friendly name of the variable. Fine for us because we know what it is, but here we are replacing that with text more appropriate for a reader. We do the same with the the `y` label.
5. The `color` and `shape` arguments are similar in that we are replacing the existing label above the legend, resetting those to capitalize "Species". We need to change them both so they are the same. (You might experiment by removing the `shape` argument and re-running it to see what happens.)

### Themes

You can change just about  _anything_ on a ggplot chart if you know the function and arguments to describe it. The [cheetsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf) shows a lot of them, but it can get really dense.

**Themes** are collections of these visual changes saved into a single function. There are several available within ggplot and [many others from the R community](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/).

Let's how that here.

1. **Edit** your code chunk to add on the last `+ theme_minimal()` function.

```{r}
#| label: p-theme
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

This changes the background color and grid lines to make the data pop a little better. There are other themes that create more radical change, some in their own packages. We'll play more later.

OK, you've made your first ggplot chart! Are you ready to make another?

## Let's build a bar chart

In our first week of class, we sent out a survey where you told us your favorite Disney Princess and favorite flavor of ice cream. Let's now play around with some of this data.

For this lesson, we're not going to create a different notebook or download the data to our computer. Instead, we're going to save the data directly into a tibble.

1. Start a new section: Importing class data
1. In the text, note that we are importing the chart data.
1. Add the code below to get the data.

```{r}
#| label: class-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false
class <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQfwR6DBW5Qv6O5aEBFJl4V8itnlDxFEc1e_-fOAtBMDxXx1GeEGb8o5VSgi33oTYqeFhVCevGGbG5y/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv") |> # <1>
  clean_names() # <2>

class # <3>
```

1. We create a new object and then fill it by reading the data directly from the web.
2. We lowercase the variable names using `clean_names()` from the janitor package.
2. Print the new object to peek at it.

So, now, you should have the data in your environment. 

And with this data, we want to build a chart like this:

```{r}
#| label: princess-example
#| echo: false

class |> clean_names() |>
  count(princess, name = "votes", sort = TRUE) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(princess, votes), y = votes)) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = votes), hjust = 2, color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Pick of the princesses",
    subtitle = str_wrap("Students in Reporting with Data each voted for their favorite Disney Princess. Some complained that Princess Leia was not an option."),
    caption = "By Jo Lukito",
    x = "Princess choices",
    y = "Number of votes"
  )
```


### Prep princess data

While there are ways for ggplot to calculate values from your data on the fly, I prefer to first build a table of the values I want, and then I will plot it on a chart. It's helpful to think of these steps as separate so you have a good workflow (clean the data, prepare the data in a table form, and then plot the data).

Today, our goal will be to make a bar chart, sometimes known as a column chart. This bar chart will show the number of votes for each princess from the data. So, we need to count the number of rows for each value ... our typical `group_by`/`summarize`/`arrange` (GSA) process. 

For this lesson, I'll use the `count()` shortcut, since we haven't used it much. Next, I'll save the summarized data into a new dataframe called `princess_data`. Follow along in your notebook:

1. Add a section: Princess data
1. Add text that you are creating a data frame to plot.
2. Add the code below to create that data.

```{r princess-summarize}
princess_data <- class |> # <1>
  count(princess, name = "votes", sort = TRUE) # <2>
  
princess_data # <3>
```

1. Start with a new object and start filling it with class data.
2. Here we use the `count()` function to count the number of rows based on the `princess` column. The argument `name =` just names the new columns something other than `n`, and the `sort =` argument sorts the data in descending order based on the counted column.
3. Print it out so we can see it.

At this point, y'all should be plenty familiar with these summary functions, and the output should be easy to interpret: we're just counting the number of rows for each princess.

Now that we have our table data, let's actually plot it.

### Build our plot with geom_col

Like in the previous lesson, we'll start our plot by creating the first layer: the `ggplot()` function, which takes the data as its first argument and the `aes()` mapping layer as its second argument. 

1. Add some text noting that you'll now plot.
1. Add the following code chunk, which is the first layer

```{r princess-base}
ggplot(
  princess_data,
  aes(x = princess, y = votes) # <1>
)
```

1. sets our x and y axes values.

You'll see the grid and x/y axis of the data, but no geometries are applied yet, so you won't see any data. But remember, we're adding these all in layers.

### Add the geom_col layer

Now it is time to add our columns. To do this, we'll use `geom_col()`. Similar to `geom_point()`, `geom_col()` adds a geometric layer that tells R how to display the data (in this case, with columns as opposed to points). Let's write this code now.

1. **Edit** the plot code to add the ggplot pipe `+` and on the next line add `geom_col()`.

```{r princess-col}
ggplot(
  princess_data,
  aes(x = princess, y = votes)
) + # <1>
  geom_col() # <2>
```

1. Don't forget to add the `+` at the end of the previous line
2. The `geom_col()` function adds the bars based on the global aesthetics we've already set.

Our two-layer chart is getting somewhere now. We're able to see the data in the plot, but there are a couple issues:

- Depending on the width of our notebook, the princess names might collide with each other. We can fix this.
- The order of the bars is alphabetical instead of in vote order. Again, we can fix it.

### Flip the axes

One way to fix the labels is to "flip" the axes, so the x axis becomes the y axis and vice versa. This is the equivalent of rotating the whole figure. When we do this, the axis will turn sideways, making it easier to read the labels. Worth noting: this can be a bit confusing later because the "x" axis is now going up/down (as opposed to left and right).

Let's learn how to flip the axes now. We'll do this by adding a new layer, `coord_flip()`, which is a special layer that flips the axes. Just like we added the previous `geom_col()` layer using `+`, we'll do the same thing here. Let's do that now.

1. **Edit** your plot chunk to add the ggplot pipe `+`and `coord_flip()` on the next line.

```{r princess-flipped}
ggplot(
  princess_data, aes(x = princess, y = votes)
) +
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() # <1>
```

1. Adding `coord_flip()` swaps the x and y axes.

As you can see, rather than having vertical bars, we now have horizontal bars, and the names of each princess are fully displayed and read-able. Much better!

But the bars are still in an alphabetical order, as opposed to a vote order, so let's fix that now.

### Reorder the bars

The bars on our chart are in alphabetical order of the x axis (and reversed thanks to our flip.) We want to order the values based on the `votes` in the data.

::: callout-note
Complication alert: Categorical data can have [factors](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors.html), which are like an internal ordering system. Some categories, like months in a year, have an "order" that is not alphabetical. We don't have that here, but know it is a thing.

We can reorder our categorical values in a plot by editing the `x` values in our `aes()` using `reorder()`. (There is a tidyverse function called `fct_reorder()` that works the same way for factors.)

`reorder()` takes two arguments: The column to reorder, and the column to base that reorder on. It can happen in two different ways, and I'll be honest and say I don't know which is easier to comprehend.

- `x = reorder(princess, votes)` says "we shall set x as reordered values of `princess` based on the order of  `votes`. OR ...
- `x = princess |> reorder(votes)` says "set the x axis as `princess` _and then_ reorder by `votes`.

They both work. Even though I'm a fan of the tidyverse ` |> ` construct, I'm going with the first version.

1. **Edit** the first line of your chunk to reorder the bars.

```{r princess-reorder}
ggplot(
  princess_data,
  aes(x = reorder(princess, votes), y = votes) # <1>
) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```

1. This is the line where `reorder()` is added.

So now, our princess names are read-able, and the bars are organized in vote size. But what if we wanted to be clearer in our figure, so that we knew the exact number of votes for each princess? Let's learn how to add this information.

### Adding a geom_text layer

Now, we're really starting to take advantage of the grammar of graphics by including more than one geometric layer. Specifically, we'll be using `geom_text()` to add some information to our bar charts. 

As we mentioned previously, `geom` layers can take individual aesthetics (that build on top of the global aesthetics you put in the first layer). When using `geom_text()`, we'll include some local aesthetics using the `aes()` argument, to tell `ggplot` the label we'd like to add to the plot.

1. **Edit** your plot chunk to add the `+` and `geom_text()` layer on the end of your code.
2. Set the aesthetics of the `geom_text()` function to plot the labels onto the chart based on the number of `votes`: `aes(label = votes)`, as noted below.

```{r princess-text-ugly}
ggplot(princess_data,
       aes(x = reorder(princess, votes), y = votes)
) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = votes)) # <1>
```

1. This plots a text layer onto the chart based on both the position and values in `votes`.

Well that did... something. We've successfully added the numbers to this plot, but it's not very pretty. First, the number is plotted at the end of the bar, making it harder to read. So we'll want to **horizontally** adjust this by shifting the numbers a bit to the left. Second, black text is really hard to read against a dark grey background. So we'll change the text of the number to white.

We can make both of these edits directly in the `geom_text` layer. 

1. **Edit** the last line of your plot chunk to add two new arguments.
2. The first argument you will add is `hjust`, which moves the text left. (`hjust` stands for horizontal justification. `vjust`, or vertical justification, would move it up and down).
3. The second argument you will add is `color`, which tells `ggplot` what the color of your text should be.

As a reminder, you should always separate your arguments within a function using commas (`,`).

```{r princess-text-clean}
ggplot(
  princess_data,
  aes(x = reorder(princess, votes), y = votes)
) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = votes), hjust = 2, color = "white") # <1>
```

1. Note that both `hjust` and `color` are NOT inside the `aes()` function because we are not using the data to control them.

Great! But we're still not done. Even though we've added labels to each bar chart, we still haven't added a title, and the titles of our x and y axes are not great. So let's work on those now.

### Add some titles and more labels

Now that we have a chart, with some information displayed in bars, flipped and arranged so we can see information, let's add to this by giving the chart some labels. We'll do this by adding a **layer** of labels to our chart using the the `labs()` function. We can add and change a number of things with `labs()`, including creating a title, and changing the x and y axis titles.

1. **Edit** the last line of your plot chunk to add the ggplot pipe `+` and `labs()` in the next line.
2. Add a title using the `title = ` argument
3. Add a subtitle using the `subtitle = ` argument. This is a great place to put information about your data (like when it was collected).
4. Add a caption using the `caption = ` argument. Put your byline here!
5. Change the x and y axes titles using `x = ` and `y = `.

```{r princess-labs}
ggplot(
  princess_data,
  aes(x = reorder(princess, votes), y = votes)
) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = votes), hjust = 2, color = "white") + 
  labs(
    title = "Pick of the princesses", # <1>
    subtitle = str_wrap("Students in Reporting with Data each voted for their favorite Disney Princess. Some complained that Princess Leia was not an option."), # <2>
    caption = "By Jo Lukito", # <3>
    x = "Princess choices", # <4>
    y = "Number of votes" # <5>
  )
```

1. A title to draw you in or communicate your goal.
2. The subtitle is the place to explain what is needed to understand the chart. In this case we wrap the text in a `str_wrap()` function so the words don't run off the chart.
3. A `caption` is a cood place to add your byline.
4. Because we use `coord_flip()` it is actually the `x` axis that is vertical.
5. Again, x and y are flipped.

There you go! You've made a chart showing how our classes rated Disney Princesses.

## On your own: Ice cream!

Now it is time for you to put these skills to work:

1. Build a chart about the favorite ice creams from RWD classes.

Some things to consider:

- You need a new section, etc.
- You're starting with the same `class` data
- You need to prepare the data based on `ice_cream` (which is the name of a variable in your `class` data frame)
- You need to build the chart

It's essentially the same process we used for the princess chart, but using `ice_cream` variable. That said, I really recommend you write all the code from scratch, ONE LINE AT A TIME, so you can soak in what each line does.

## What we've learned

There is a ton, really.

- ggplot2 (which is really the `ggplot()` function) is the charting library for the tidyverse. This whole lesson was about it.
- We also covered `reorder()`, which can reorder a variable based on the values in a different variable.

Here are some more references for ggplot:

- [The ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) and [ggplot2 cheatsheets](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).
- [R for Data Science, Chap 3.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html) Hadley Wickham dives right into plots in his book.
- [ggplot2: Elegant graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) by Wickham.
- [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) has lots of example plots. Good to harvest code and see how to do things.
- [The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) another place to see examples.
