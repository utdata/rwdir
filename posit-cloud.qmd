title: "Using posit.cloud"
---

If you are using the online version of RStudio called [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) then there are some things that work differently than with the desktop version. This chapter is to designed to help with that.

## Create a web project from our template

Since posit.cloud does not have an option to create a "Quarto Website" project, we have put together a template for you to start from.

1. Start posit.cloud if you haven't already
1. Click on this link: [RWD PositCloud Template](https://posit.cloud/content/6431752)
1. At the top of the browser window, there is a button to save the template as your own project called **Save a Permanent Copy**.

1. Rename your project right away so you don't forget.

1. Update the `index.qmd` file with information about your project.
1. Update your `_quarto.yml` file as you wish.

The base packages should already be installed, so you should be good to add new Quarto Documents and Render them.

## Exporting a project

You can export your project as a `.zip` file to turn in to an assignment or share with others.

1. In the **Files** pane, click the box next to the *Cloud* icon to select all your files.
2. Under the **More** gear there is a dropdown. Click on that.
3. Choose **Export** from the More menu.

This should download all your files as a `.zip` file, which you can upload to Canvas.

## Share your project

It is possible to share your posit.cloud project with another user on the service (like your instructor) and they will get a copy of it.

You can find [directions for that here](https://posit.cloud/learn/guide#intro-share).

## Building a web project from scratch

If you can't or don't want to start with the template above (like you already have a project started), you can build your own Quarto Website.

### Create your project

1. Start posit.cloud if you haven't already
1. If you aren't in a project already, create one. Use the **New Project** button and choose **New RStudio project**.
1. In your Console, copy and paste this command and run it.

    ```r
    install.packages(c("quarto", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "janitor"))
    ```

    It will take some time to run. Your internet connection will have an impact on the speed.

### Create the Quarto file

1. Use the new document toolbar button to create a **Text file**.
2. Paste in the code below.
3. Save the file and name it `_quarto.yml`.

The name must be exact.

```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Site name"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      #- filename.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
    df-print: paged
    code-overflow: wrap
```

### Create your index file

1. Use the new document toolbar button to create a new **Quarto Document**
2. For the Title field, use your project name, like "Billboard project"
3. Uncheck the visual editor button.
4. Immediately save the file and name it `index.qmd`

At some point you'll likely add a new file and want to replace `filename.qmd` with your filename and remove the `#` comment. You'll can add other files there as you create them. This adds them to the website navigation. You can learn about website navigation in the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html).

**You should be good to go with a new project at this point.** You can Render your index to see what the site looks like at this point.
