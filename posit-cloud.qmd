title: "Using posit.cloud"
---

If you are using the online version of RStudio called [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) then there are some things that work differently than with the desktop version. This chapter is to designed to help with that.

## Setting up a new project

Since posit.cloud works with projects be default, there are not templates with example files. Since we are working with the [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) project type in this class, you have to manually configure some files. It isn't hard.

1. Start posit.cloud if you haven't already
2. Start a new project
3. At the top of the page, you should name your project something other than "Untitled Project"

### Install packages

This is a list of the packages we use the most in the class. I would start with these, and install others only as needed.

1. In the Console, copy and paste this command and run it.


```r
install.packages(c(
  "quarto",
  "rmarkdown",
  "tidyverse",
  "janitor"
  )
)
```

It will take some time to run. Your internet connection will have an impact on the speed.

### Create the Quarto file


1. Use the new document toolbar button to create a **Text file**
2. Paste in the code below.
3. Save the file and name it `_quarto.yml`.

The name must be exact.

```yml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "today"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - filename.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
    df-print: paged
```

### Create your index file

1. Use the new document toolbar button to create a new **Quarto Document**
2. For the Title field, use your project name, like "Billboard project"
3. Uncheck the visual editor button
4. Immediately save the file and name it `index.qmd`

At some point you'll replace the `filename.qmd` with your cleaning notebooks filename. You'll add other files there as you create them.

**You should be good to go with a new project at this point.** You an Render your index to see what the site looks like at this point.

## Exporting a project

You can export your project as a `.zip` file to turn in to an assignment or share with others.

1. In the **Files** pane, click the box next to the *Cloud* icon to select all your files.
2. Under the **More** gear there is a dropdown. Click on that.
3. Choose **Export** from the More menu.

This should download all your files as a `.zip` file, which you can upload to Canvas.

## Share your project

It is possible to share your posit.cloud project with another user on the service and they will get a copy of it.

You can find [directions for that here](https://posit.cloud/learn/guide#intro-share).
