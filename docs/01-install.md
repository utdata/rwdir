# Install Party {#install}

Let's get this party started.

> NOTE: R and RStudio are already installed on lab computers.

## Mac vs PC

I use a Mac in class and in my examples. I'm a big fan of using keyboard commands to do operations in any program, but I reference this from a Mac perspective. So if I say use *Cmd+S* or *Command+S* to save, that might be *Cntl+S* or *Control+S* on a PC. The letters may not be the same on a PC, but you can usually figure it out by look at menu items in RStudio to figure out the PC command.

We will install R and RStudio. Directions are below, but you can also follow [this tutorial](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/).

## Installing R

Our first task is to install the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) onto your computer. 

- Go to the <https://cloud.r-project.org/>.
- Click on the link for your operating system.
- The following steps will differ slightly based on your operating system.
    + For Macs, you want the "latest package"
    + For Windows, you want the "base" package. You'll need to decide whether you want the 32- or 64-bit version. (Unless you've got a pretty old system, chances are you'll want 64-bit.)

Here's hoping it will be self explanatory after that.

You'll never "launch" R as a program in a traditional sense, but you need it on your computers. We'll use RStudio, which is next.

## Installing RStudio

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an "integrated development environment" -- or IDE -- for programming in R. Basically, it's the program you will use when doing work for this class.

- Go to <https://www.rstudio.com/download>.
- Scroll down to the versions and find **RStudio Desktop** and click on the **Download** button.
- It should take you down the page to the version you need for your computer.
- Install it. Should be like installing any other program on your computer.

## Class project folder

To keep things consistent and help with troubleshooting, I'd like you to save your work in the same location all the time.

- On both Mac and Windows, every user has a "Documents" folder. Open that folder. (If you don't know where it is, ask me to help you find it.)
- Create a new folder called "rwd". Use all lowercase letters.

When we create new "Projects", I want you to always save them in the `Documents/rwd` folder. This just keeps us all on the same page.
