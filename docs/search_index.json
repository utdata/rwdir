The most recent full version is v1 from Fall 2021. Reporting with Data in R is a series of lessons and instructions used for courses in the School of Journalism and Media, Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin. Assistant Professor Jo Lukito joins Assistant Professor of Practice Christian McDonald in teaching sections of the Reporting with Data for Spring 2022. This means the book is morphing from the voice of a single author and that process might get ugly. This work is written in bookdown and the source is available on Github. 0.1 A word from Christian I’m a strong proponent of what I call Scripted Journalism, a method of committing data-centric journalism in a programmatic, repeatable and transparent way. There are a myriad of programming languages that further this, including Python (pandas using Jupyter) and JavaScript (Observable), but we’ll be using R, RMarkdown and RStudio. R is a super powerful, open-source programming language for data that is deep with features and an awesome community of users who build upon it. No matter the challenge before you in your data storytelling, there is probably a package available to help you solve that challenge. Probably more than one. About my philosphy There is always more than one way to do things in R. This book is a Tidyverse-oriented, opinionated collection of lessons intended to teach students new to programming and R for the expressed act of committing journalism. As a beginner course, I strive to make it as simple as possible, which means I may not go into detail about alternative (and possibly better) ways to accomplish tasks in favor of staying in the Tidyverse and reducing options to simplify understanding. Tips on the book style Will will try to be consistent in the way we write documentation and lessons. But we are human, so sometimes we break our own rules, but in general keep the following in mind. Things to do Things to DO are in ordered lists: Do this thing. Then do this thing. Explanations are usually in text, like this very paragraph. Sometimes details will be explained in lists: This is the first thing I want you to know. This is the second. You don’t have to DO these things, just know about them. Notes, some important We will use the blockquote syntax to set off irrelevant background: Markdown was developed by JOHN GRUBER, as outlined on his Daring Fireball blog. But sometimes those asides are important. We usually indicate that: IMPORTANT: You really should learn how to use Rmarkdown as you will use it the whole semester, and hopefully for the rest of your life. Copy code blocks When you see R code in the instructions, you can roll your cursor over the right-corner and click on the copy icon to copy the code to your clipboard: Copy to clipboard You can then paste the code inside your R chunk. That said, typing code yourself has many, many benefits. You learn better when you type yourself, make mistakes and have to fix them. We encourage you to always type short code snippets. Leave the copying to long ones.

Other resources This text stands upon the shoulders of giants and by design does not cover all aspects of using R. Here are some other useful books, tutorials and sites dedicated to R. There are other task-specific tutorials and articles sprinkled throughout the book in the Resources section of select chapters. R Journalism Examples, a companion piece of sorts to this book with example code to accomplish specific tasks. It is a work-in-progress, and quite nascent at that. R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. The Tidyverse site, which has tons of documentation and help. The RStudio Cheatsheets. R Graphics Cookbook The R Graph Gallery another place to see examples. Practical R for Journalism by Sharon Machlis, an editor with PC World and related publications. Sharon is a longtime proponent of using R in journalism. Sports Data Analysis and Visualization and Data Journalism with R and the Tidyverse by Matt Waite, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. R for Journalists site by Andrew Tran, a reporter at the Washington Post. A series of videos and tutorials on using R in a journalism setting.
