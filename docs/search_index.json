I’m a strong proponent of Scripted Journalism, a method of committing data-centric journalism in a programatic, repeatable and transparent way. There are a myriad of programming languages that further this, including Python (pandas and Jupyter) and JavaScript (Observable), but we’ll be using R, RMarkdown and RStudio. R is a super powerful, open-source programming language for data that is deep with features and an awesome communinity of users who build upon it. No matter the challenge before you in your data storytelling, there is probably a package available to help you solve that challenge. Probably more than one. There is always more than one way to do things in R. This course is an opinionated collection of lessons intended to teach students new to R and programming for the expressed act of committing journalism. As a beginner course, I strive to make it as simple as possible, which means I may not go into detail about alternative (and possibly better) ways to accomplish tasks. About the author I’m a career journalist who most recently served as Data and Projects Editor at the Austin American-Statesman before coming to the University of Texas at Austin full-time in Fall 2018. I’ve taught data-related course at UT since 2013. UT Github: utdata Github: critmcdonald Twitter: crit Email: christian.mcdonald@utexas.edu "],

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the Preview button or press Cmd+Shift+K to preview the HTML file). The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike Knit, Preview does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. "],
