This will use Billboard data.

## About the story

Through the course of the next several chapters, we'll be using the Billboard Hot 100 charts data to find the answers to the following questions:

1. Who are the 10 Artists with the most appearances on the Hot 100 chart at any position?
2. Which Artist had the most Titles to reach No. 1?
3. Which Artist had the most Titles to reach No. 1 in the most recent five years?
4. Who had the most Top 10 hits overall?
5. Which Artist/Title combination has been on the charts the most number of weeks at any position?
6. Which Artist/Title combination was No. 1 for the most number of weeks?

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: What are your guesses for the questions above? No peeking!

Before we can get into the analysis, we need to set up our project.
