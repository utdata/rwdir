# About this class {-}

This collection of lessons is intended to support the class Reporting With Data, taught by me, Christian McDonald, at the School of Journalism, Moody College of Communication, University of Texas at Austin.

I'm a strong proponent of Scripted Journalism, a method of committing data-centric journalism in a programmatic, repeatable and transparent way. There are a myriad of programming languages that further this, including Python ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)) and JavaScript ([Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/)), but we'll be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

R is a super powerful, open-source programming language for data that is deep with features and an awesome community of users who build upon it. No matter the challenge before you in your data storytelling, there is probably a package available to help you solve that challenge. Probably more than one.

There is always more than one way to do things in R. This course is an opinionated collection of lessons intended to teach students new to R and programming for the expressed act of committing journalism. As a beginner course, I strive to make it as simple as possible, which means I may not go into detail about alternative (and possibly better) ways to accomplish tasks.

## Other resources {-}

This text stands upon the shoulders of giants and by design does not cover all aspects of using R. Here are some other useful books, tutorials and sites dedicated to R.

- [R Journalism Examples](https://utdata.github.io/r-journalism-examples/), a companion piece of sorts to this book with example code to accomplish specific tasks. It is a work-in-progress, and quite nascent at that.
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
- The [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) site, which has tons of documentation and help.
- The [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).
- [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
- [The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) another place to see examples.
- [R for Journalists](http://learn.r-journalism.com/en/) site by Andrew Tran, a reporter at the Washington Post. A series of videos and tutorials on using R in a journalism setting.
- [Practical R for Journalism](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918) by Sharon Machlis, an editor with PC World and related publications, she is a longtime proponent of using R in journalism.
