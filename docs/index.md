# About this class

This collection of lessons is intended to support the class Reporting With Data, taught by me, Christian McDonald, at the School of Journalism, Moody College of Communication, University of Texas at Austin.

I'm a strong proponent of Scripted Journalism, a method of committing data-centric journalism in a programatic, repeatable and transparent way. There are a myriad of programming languages that further this, including R, Python (especially pandas and Jupyter) and [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/), but we'll be using R and RStudio.

R is a super powerful, open-source programming language for data that is deep with features and an awesome communinity of users who build upon it. No matter the challenge before you in your data storytelling, there is probably a package available to help you solve that challenge. Probably more than one.

There is always more than one way to do things in R. This course is an opinionated collection of lessons intended to teach students new to R and programming for the expressed act of committing journalism. As a beginner course, I strive to make it as simple as possible, which means I may not go into detail about alternative (and possibly better) ways to accomplish tasks.
