-   [The ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) and [ggplot2 cheatsheets](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).
-   [R for Data Science, Data visualization](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html) Hadley Wickham dives right into plots in his book.
-   [ggplot2: Elegant graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) is another book by Wickham.
-   [ggplot2Tor](https://ggplot2tor.com/) is a website full of ggplot tutorials, tools and courses.
-   [BBC Visual Cookbook](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/).
-   [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) has lots of example plots. Good to harvest code and see how to do things.
-   [The R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) another place to see examples.
