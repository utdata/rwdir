# ggplot chart examples

With this we'll use the `[starwars]()` dataset to show some super basic examples of chart types, with some annotations about the code.

```{r setup include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```


```{r data-sources}
starwars <- starwars
candy <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRCGayKLOy-52gKmEoPOj3ZKnOQVtCiooSloiCr-i_ci27e4n1CMPL0Z9s6MeFX9oQuN9E-HCFJnWjD/pub?gid=1456715839&single=true&output=csv") %>% clean_names()
sped <- read_rds("data-processed/01-sped-districts.rds")
```

The starwars data is structured like this:

```{r sw-glimpse} 
starwars %>% glimpse()
```

The candy data looks like this:

```{r}
candy %>% glimpse()
```

Special education data

```{r}

sped %>% glimpse()
```

## Column chart

Basic column chart to plot a number based on differen categories.

```{r col-chart}
starwars %>%
  head(10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mass, y = name )) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = mass, hjust = 1.5), color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Heaviest Star Wars characters",
    subtitle = str_wrap("More here and this can get long because we have put it inside an str_wrap function which keeps it from writing off the chart."),
    x = "Weight in kilograms",
    y = "Character",
    caption = "Could be a source or byline or both",
    alt = "Alternative text for screen readers"
  )
```

### Column with sped

```{r sped_col_wrangle}
sped_col_data <- sped %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_count = sum(all_count),
    sped_count = sum(sped_count),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(sped_rate = ((sped_count / total_count) * 100) %>% round(1)) %>% 
  select(year, sped_rate)
```


```{r}
sped_col_data

ggplot(sped_col_data, aes(x = year, y = sped_rate)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = sped_rate, vjust = 2), color = "white")
```

### Line with sped


```{r}


sped_line_data <- sped %>% 
  filter(cntyname == "TRAVIS",
         distname != "UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN H S") %>% 
  group_by(year, distname) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_count = sum(all_count),
    sped_count = sum(sped_count),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(sped_rate = ((sped_count / total_count) * 100) %>% round(1)) %>% 
  select(1,2,5)
```


```{r}
sped_line_data

sped_line_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sped_rate, group = distname)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = distname)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0,16)
```



### Column chart explanation

- We are starting with `starwars` data.
- `head(10)` just cuts our data to 10 rows so we don't have so many bars. You'll likely start your chart with specific data for your own purposes.
- `ggplot()` is our charting function.
  - ggplot needs "global aesthetics" (the `aes()` function) to know the data to use, and which variables to consider on the X and Y axes. Here we have set `x = mass` which will plot that value from left to right. We've set `y = name`.
- `geom_col()` plots the bars the length of the value in `mass`.
- `goem_text()` plots type on the chart based on the `mass`, which means it puts the center of the text at the position of the value (right at the end of the bar.)
  - We are applying a local aesthetic here as an argument in `geom_text()`. We are saying with `label = mass` that for our text label, use the value in the `mass` field for that row. The `hjust = 1` moves that text label from the exact location of mass, toward the left by a value. A `-1` would move it the other way.
  - `color = "white"` is another argument for `geom_text())`. It's not really an aesthetic, so it is not inside the `aes()` function.
- `labs()` are labels, and this is a selection of them. Most 
  
### Column chart ordered

Here is the same chart as above, but we've reordered the Y data (`name`) based on the vales in `mass`.

```{r col-reordered}
starwars %>%
  head(10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mass, y = reorder(name, mass) )) + # the reorder is in this line
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = mass, hjust = 1.5), color = "white")
```

There is a `geom_bar()`, but it doesn't plot raw values from your dataset. By default it counts the number of observations based on a variable. There are other plot types that calculate "stats" from your data through [statistical transformations](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html?q=geom_bar#statistical-transformations), like histograms.

## A line chart

```r
ggplot(wells_county_year, aes(x=year_drilled, y=wells_drilled)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=county)) +
  labs(title = "Wells by county and year", x = "Year", y = "Number of wells")
```

![Wells drilled by county by year](images/visualize-county-year-line.png){width=500px}

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(factor(birth_year)) %>% 
  summarise(n()) %>% 
  arrange()
  

USAccDeaths

starwars %>% 
  count(factor(birth_year), name = "Count", sort = T)
  head() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ))
```


### Explanation

- A `geom_line()` needs either a `group=` or a `color=` to "split" the lines on a category across the graphic. This example does this by setting a specific `aes()` color value in the `geom_line()` call.
- In this example, the title and pretty x and y labels are added with `labs()`

## Scatterplot

```r
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) + # added color aesthetic
  geom_smooth()
```

![MPG: disply vs mpg with class](images/visualize-mpg-03.png)

### Explanation

- This plot uses the `mpg` data ggplot. It is comparing `displ` (the size of an engine) to `mpg`, the miles per gallon of the car.
- The `goem_point()` adds a new aesthetic to color the dots based on another value in the data, the `class`.
- The [`geom_smooth()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html) plot adds a line showing the average of the points at each position. This helps you determine if there is a relationshiop between the two variables.

## Histogram

A histogram is a distribution of a number in your data. It's super useful in helping understand your data, but difficult to explain to readers.

We'll use the well's data column `borehole_depth` to explore this. The question is this: Are most wells shallow or deep? We can explore this with the histogram.

```r
wells %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = borehole_depth)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  labs(title = "Depth of wells", subtitle = "More than 7,500 of the 18,000 wells drilled since 2005 are less than 100-feet deep.", y = "Wells drilled", x = "Depth in 100ft increments")
```

The histogram chart defaults to splitting into 30 even groups, but you can change that in a couple of ways.

- Using `bin = 40` will set a different number of bins.
- Using `binwidth = 100` will create bins based on your x value.

That yields this chart:

![Histogram example](images/examples-histogram01.png)

You can add labels to note the number of records in each bin with the `stat_bin()` function, which is a bit different than other ggplot functions. Here's an example in the last line of this plot:

```r
wells %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = borehole_depth)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  labs(title = "Depth of wells", subtitle = "More than 7,500 of the 18,000 wells drilled since 2005 are less than 100-feet deep.", y = "Wells drilled", x = "Depth in 100ft increments") +
  stat_bin(binwidth = 100, geom="text", aes(label = ..count..), vjust=-.5)
```

## Titles, labels and other cleanup

Titles and labels are added as new layers on a graphic. These examples just show the line that adds the new layer.

### Title and axis labels

```r
yourchartsofar +
  labs(title = "Wells by county and year", x = "Year", y = "Number of wells")
```

### Flip the graphic

Sometime you want to turn a graphic 90 degrees to you can read long values, or make a bar chart horizontal instead of vertical.

```r
yourchartsofar +
  coord_flip()
```
### Fix exponential numbers on an axis

```r
yourchartsofar +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)
```

You can do the same for `scale_x_continuous()` if needed.

## Interactivity with plotly

This requires a library in addition to the tidyverse called `library(plotly)`. The idea is that you:

- create a ggplot graphic.
- save that entire graphic to a new R object.
- Call the `ggplotly()` function with that new variable.

```
saved_plot <- wells_county_year %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_drilled, y = wells_drilled, color = county)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Wells drilled per county" )

# shove into ggploty
ggplotly(saved_plot)
```

This screen shot below is not interactive, but you can see the hover tool tip displayed.
