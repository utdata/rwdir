# Install Party {#install}

Let's get this party started.

> NOTE: R and RStudio are already installed on lab computers.

## Installing R

Our first task is to install the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) onto your computer. There are a number of "mirrors" which have the software.

- Go to the [download site](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
- Go down to USA and choose one of the links there. They should all work the same.
- Click on the link for your operating system.
- The following steps will differ slightly based on your operating system.
    + For Macs, you want the "latest package"
    + For Windows, you want the "base" package. You'll need to decide whether you want the 32- or 64-bit version. (Unless you've got a pretty old system, chances are you'll want 64-bit.)

Here's hoping it will be self explanatory after that.

## Installing RStudio

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an "integrated development environment" -- or IDE -- for programming in R. Basically, it's the program you will use when doing work for this class.

- Go to <https://www.rstudio.com> and find the "Download" button.
- Find the "Free" versions and find the installer for your operating system and download it.
- Install it. Should be like installing any other program.

## Class project folder

To keep things consistent and help with troubleshooting, I'd like you to save your work in the same location all the time.

- On both Mac and Windows, every user has a "Documents" folder. Open that folder. (If you don't know where it is, ask me to help you find it.)
- Create a new folder called "rwd". Use all lowercase letters.

When we create new "Projects", I want you to always save them in the `Documents/rwd` folder.
