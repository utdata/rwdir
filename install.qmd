# Install Party {#install}

Let's get this party started.

## Mac vs PC

I'm a big fan of using keyboard commands to do operations in any program, but I use a Mac so keyboard commands come from that perspective. So I say use *Cmd+S* or *Command+S* to save, that translates to *Cntl+S* or *Control+S* on a PC. You can typically just switch *Cmd* (for Mac) and *Cntl* (for PC), but occasionally there are other differences. You can usually check menu items in RStudio to figure out the command for your computer.

## RStudio vs posit.cloud

This book is written assuming the use of the RStudio IDE application, which is free and available for Macs, PC's and Linux. In cases where computers have trouble running R and Rstudio, it is possible to to use the online [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) version of RStudio. If you are using posit.cloud for the Reporting with Data class, you'll likely hit a pay tier at some point. The Student plan at \$5/mo is typically sufficient. You may find some specific posit.cloud instructions in this book, but I don't outline every difference.

Otherwise below we will install R and RStudio on your computer. It might take some time depending on your Internet connection. **If you are doing this on your own** you might follow [this tutorial](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/), but below you'll find the basic steps.

## Installing R and RStudio

In step 1 noted below you will install the R language. You'll never "launch" R as a program in a traditional sense, but you need it on your computer.

The second step is to install [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) which is what actually use in class. It is an "integrated development environment" -- or IDE -- for programming in R. Basically, it's the program you will use when doing work for this class.

1.  Go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. The first link to install R will take you to <https://cloud.r-project.org/>.
    - Click on the link for your operating system.
    -   For Macs, you'll need to know if you have an Apple or Intel chip. Go under the Apple menu to **About this Mac** and you should be able to see if you have *Apple* or *Intel*. You'll choose which download based on that.
    -   For Windows, you want the "base" package. You'll need to decide whether you want the 32- or 64-bit version. (Unless you've got a pretty old system, chances are you'll want 64-bit.)

2.  **After you've done step 1** on that page to install R. Go to Step 2!
    -  There should be a big blue button with **DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP** for you operating system. Click on that to download it.
    - On a Mac you need to double-click on the .dmg file to open it and then drag the RStudio icon on top of the Application icon. This copies the software to your computer. After that is done you can eject the .dmg disc.
    - On PCs, run the downloaded .exe file.

### Getting "Git" errors on Macs

If later during package installation you get errors that mention "git" or "xcode-select" then **say yes!** and do it. It might take some time. If it doesn't finish, then try again the next time it comes up.

## Install Quarto

Go to the [Quarto Getting Started page](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and there should be a big blue button that links to the software for your computer. Follow the prompts to install. We are only doing that Step 1 listed here.

## Class project folder

To keep things consistent and help with troubleshooting, I recommend that you save your work in the same location all the time.

-   On both Mac and Windows, every user has a "Documents" folder. Open that folder. (If you don't know where it is, ask for help to find it.)
-   Create a new folder called "rwd". Use all lowercase letters.

When we create new "Projects", I want you to always save them in the `Documents/rwd` folder. This just keeps us all on the same page.
